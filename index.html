          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <article>
            <h3>Parakeets in the wild</h3>
            <p>The budgerigar, also known as the common
              parakeet or shell parakeet, is a small, long-tailed, seed-eating parrot usually nicknamed the budgie or in
              American English, the parakeet.
              Budgies are the only species in the genus Melopsittacus. Naturally, the species is green and yellow with
              black, scalloped markings on the nape, back, and wings.</p>
            <p>They are found wild throughout the drier parts of Australia, where they have survived harsh inland
              conditions for over
              five million years. Their success can be attributed to a nomadic lifestyle and their ability to breed
              while on the
              move. </p>
            <p>Flocks normally range from 3 to 100 birds, but after rainfall can number many
              thousands!

              Budgies inhabit savannas, grasslands, open forests, grassy woodlands and farmland. They’re usually found
              near water because they need to drink each day. Budgerigars typically drink during the morning, consuming
              up to 5.5% of their body weight daily! But living in an arid
              environment they’re very ‘water hardy’. If there’s no standing water nearby, they’ll drink early morning
              dew and ‘bathe’
              in wet grass.The budgerigar is closely related to lories and the fig
              parrots.</p>

                <h3> Parakeets As Pets</h3>

                <p>Budgerigars have been bred in captivity since the 1850s and are now one of the world’s best known
                  pet
                  birds,
                  ranking just behind dogs and cats. This
                  affectionate, cute bird is small and inexpensive, and if trained properly a Budgie can mimic human
                  speech.
                  These small
                  parrots make delightful pets and are usually friendly and easy to tame. The Budgie has been bred
                  into a
                  huge
                  range of colours and patterns
                  from mauve, olive and blue to pure white.</p>
                <p>Budgies only grow to a small size, with an adult generally weighing between 30-60 grams. They can
                  be
                  housed
                  individually or in groups.</p>

              <h3>Pet Type / American Budgie</h3>
              <i>First two birds from the left are Pet-type Parakeets.&#128073;</i>
              <p class="p-after">The American Budgie is also called the Australian Budgie because genetically, they
                are
                much
                closer to their
                wild
                cousins. The American Budgie is smaller than the English and is between 177mm - 228mm tall, and
                weighs
                24g - 40g on
                average. Additionally, they can be identified by the plumage, which is just as vibrant but with less
                defined
                markings.
                American Budgies also have a wider variety of color variations.

                These budgies have not undergone as much selective breeding and therefore can vary widely in
                coloring and
                appearance.
                However, the American budgie lives a bit longer than the English, around 8-10 years on average.</p>


              <h3>Show Type / English budgie</h3>
              <i>Third bird on the right is a show budgie.&#x261B;</i>
              <p>The most apparent difference between the English Budgie and the Americans is that the English are
                much
                larger. English
                Budgies are 250mm - 50mm high and weigh 40g - 60g on average. English Budgies also have more
                defined
                color markings
                on their plumageThe English Budgie is also referred to as the Show Budgie or Exhibition Budgie and
                has
                been
                selectively bred for years.
                There are over one hundred different acceptable color variations and patterns for show quality
                birds.
                However,
                this
                selective breeding has resulted in a slightly shorter lifespan. English Budgies live between 7-9
                years on
                average.</p>

                  <h3>What You Need To Know Before Owning a Parakeet</h3>

                  <ul class="homepageList">
                    <li><strong>Housing</strong> - A good-sized cage
                      Your budgie’s cage or aviary should give them room to spread their wings – they love to
                      stretch
                      out.
                      You will need a cage cover it creates a cosy spot for your budgie to sleep in with a cage
                      cover
                      on. Your
                      budgie will feel safe and secure and
                      the cover and will help them develop a sleep routine.
                      Bird bath
                      Budgies love the water and keeping themselves well groomed, so a bird bath is a great addition
                      to their
                      home. You can
                      find plastic options that clip onto the side of the cage.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Nutrition</strong> - Food and water dishes.

                      Seed or pelleted food
                      Find a high-quality food specifically formulated for your budgie to give them their best start
                      in life
                      and
                      keep them
                      healthy.
                      Millet
                      Budgies love eating from a long branch of millet.
                      Vitamin supplement
                      There’s a range of supplements available that can target everything from your budgie’s beak
                      and
                      feather
                      health to
                      general wellbeing.
                      Iodine/mineral block
                      Make sure your pet is getting all the nutrients they need and keeping their beak in top shape
                      with an
                      iodine
                      or mineral
                      block for them to gnaw on.
                      Cuttlefish
                      Adding this to their cage will keep their beak healthy and act as a good source of calcium.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Toys</strong> - A variety of toys
                      Make your budgie’s home a fun-filled play station with an assortment of
                      toys. They
                      love toys with a mirror and ones that can be shredded are also great.
                      Perches and swings
                      Your playful pet needs different zones in their cage to keep them entertained. Your budgie’s
                      cage should
                      come with a
                      perch, but it’s good to include a swing for an extra activity. </li>
                    <li><strong>Health</strong> -
                      Just like cats and dogs, budgies need to be dewormed. Talk to your local Vets about the best
                      one
                      for your pet,
                      but using a syrup that’s added to their water supply works well for most budgies.
                      Parasite powder
                      Your budgie may contract mites or lice, so your best bet is to have a treatment powder ready.
                    </li>
